# Twitch Fox
~~An addon for Mozilla Firefox that sets off an alarm when a followed Twitch.tv streamer goes online.~~

An add-on for Mozilla Firefox that let's you fully experience and browse Twitch.tv quickly and easily. Includes alerts for followed channels and games, and has support for Livestreamer


The .xpi file is what is actually installed into Firefox. The rest of the files are merely the code in its uncompiled format.

Previously known as Twitch Alarm.


This version of Twitch Fox is now deprecated because it uses the no-longer supported Firefox Add-on SDK.
